            <strong>THE COST OF CONSENT: The Ethics of Adult Films and The Porn Industry</strong><br><br>
            The search history on my laptop browser is a hot mess: Online shopping, food deliveries, Buzzfeed articles, news, and lots of porn. <br>
            There are at least four videos with the same plotline, each actor looking eerily similar; the same bodies, Caucasian, all slim and toned, rounded biceps and deep-cut V&#39;s at their waistlines, begging for fingers at the hips – an image I have never come across in reality. Do these boys even exist? Or are they only found in site links embedded in search bars? <br>
            In one of the videos, a guy who looks barely eighteen, blond hair, blue eyes, skinny and hairless, dressed only in white socks, kneels at the feet of his fifty-something year-old partner, chin dripping with saliva. His pale buttocks glows red, a handprint slapped into his flesh like branding, as he wipes tears from his pretty almond eyes. I shudder, uncomfortable, and close the tab. The truth is, this was not the first time I&#39;d come across violence in porn. As a gay man, who exclusively watches gay porn, free sex films are limited to endless choking, spanking and forced penetration, rippling concerningly close to rape culture. If you want meaningful, consensual sex, it comes at a price. <br>
            All in all, porn – specifically, gay porn – is rarely free. And I understand why: Producers, directors, film crew, the actors – all have to get paid. Behind every porno, there are fees and costs, no matter the genre or talent. But how does monetizing ethical porn make producers look? And how does it make us react when we watch anything else? <br>
            Watching people have sex on film is fun – invigorating, even. There&#39;s no denying that it&#39;s something A LOT of people do, and for that reason, it can be liberating. According to adequateman.com, it&#39;s not  just the actors who can take part in an essential change of ethics in the porn industry – it&#39;s down to producers, screenwriters and directors, too. Most porn companies (or at least the six I researched) have codes of conduct on set, including, &#39;Treating actors with respect&#39;, &#39;Demonstrating real pleasure&#39;, and, my personal favourite, &#39;Emphasising diversity&#39;. The problem here? Each of these companies require a paid subscription. <br>
            Producing ethical porn is no easy task. It takes a lot more than just consent, toned-down adverts and simple access; the prices reflect that. People chinwag about accessing and spending money on sex films online; why buy when so much of what the internet offers is free to the public? But are things like validity, consent and diversity worth throwing a couple of dollars at? There is plenty of potential to change the porn industry – we just need to be willing enough to support natural sex and all of its glory. <br>
