                    <strong>John Eggleston on His Novel Hand-Crafted Homewares</strong><br>
                    Angelica Willis

                    Nineteen-year-old Tasmanian John Eggleston is a craftsman who uses fractal burning on his woodwares. Fractal burning is using high voltage electricity to create lightning-like figures on timber. These lightening shapes are technically called Lichtenberg figures and are part of his distinct style. Although, it is dangerous Eggleston is highly skilled in his craft and has his homewares featured in stores state and nationwide. 
                    I interview John Eggleston on his fascination with fractal burning, how his business has been affected by coronavirus and how he has overcome those challenges.

                    <strong>What inspired you to start fractal burning?</strong>
                    I was researching in Year 11 because I had a project and I was building a table. I was looking on the computer and there was a video about how you can make patterns on wood by running electricity through it. I gave it a go and it turned out to work pretty well. I started selling this stuff and it turned out to snowball into something substantial.<br>

                    <strong>What made you start a business?</strong>
                    I&#39;m studying Paramedical science at University currently. Most people in University work a part-time job. The thing about that is that once you leave a part time job, it is gone for good. You might get a good word from the boss but with a business you can keep that, and you can grow it. Even if you start a new job. You can just keep growing and building it and it never goes away.<br>

                    <strong>Why have you chosen fractal burning as your main craft?</strong>
                    I was wanting to branch out and do other things. But I ended up sticking to this one mainly because it was so popular, and the demand is so high. There is other stuff I am interested in trying. There is this Japanese technique called Shou Sugi Ban. It is really cool. I would like to give that a go as well. If I don&#39;t risk killing myself in the process.<br>

                    <strong>Speaking of getting yourself killed, is there any safety precautions you do to prevent that from happening?</strong>
                    Well I suppose don&#39;t splash water everywhere that&#39;s the biggest one. Don&#39;t touch the wood whatever you do. Do not touch the table whatever you do. Check the power before you touch the wood and take the clamps off because sometimes if all the water sizzles out the power can still be on and it can make no noise or movement whatsoever. You need to check the power. That&#39;s why they call electricity a soul killer.<br>

                    <strong>Where do you sell your homewares?</strong>
                    I started off at the Penguin Market, but I don&#39;t go there anymore. Since then I stock my products in Design Tasmania in Launceston, Aspect design in Hobart and Brush Rabbit in Deloraine. I do also have some shops up in the mainland. <br>

                    <strong>Has your business been affected by coronavirus?</strong>
                    My business has been affected massively by coronavirus. I had about 20 shops left currently and almost all of them have come down to a grinding halt during this corona epidemic. What I&#39;m working on right now is building my online presence. I think I&#39;ve had a good start doing that. It seems to be going well so no complaints here. <br>

                    <strong>What&#39;s the largest piece you have created?</strong>
                    It was a huge wall piece and it was about 1 meter by 2 meter maybe a little less and it had a Buddha. I put gold epoxy, so it looks like he is shooting out a gold aura of light in a form of a Lichtenberg figure. <br>

                    <strong>Has your practice changed overtime?</strong>
                    Yes, in a way. I know the best ratios for mixing the conductive fluid and I know which woods work best and how much I sand each piece of wood before I burn. Little improvements like that nothing too massive. I try to do new things like experiment with new kinds of wood and put epoxy resin in the burn. That sort of stuff. New treatments on treating the wood. New products potentially same pattern made with electricity but medium like putting an electrical discharge through a block of acrylic to look like a 3D sculpture. <br>

                    <strong>Professionally, what is your goal?</strong>
                    I would love to get my business overseas. I&#39;m using my online presence to stretch worldwide, and I aim to get 50 ships domestically around Australia by the end of the year.<br>
