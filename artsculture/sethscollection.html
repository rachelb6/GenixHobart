                <strong>Seth Kieley is a collector from Blackmans Bay, Tasmania, who has estimated a value of $10,000 from over 250 Pop! Vinyl figurines. <br><br></strong>
                Mr. Kiely says his obsession with the Vinyl characters begun after he received his first model of Daryl Dixon, from the hit series The Walking Dead, as a gift from his partner in 2017. <br><br>
                &#34;It&#39;s highly addicting. Every character is different, and some are worth hundreds of dollars. Once I started collecting, I couldn&#39;t stop,	&#34; he said. <br><br>
                After prices for the collectibles began to peak over a five-year phase, Seth has continued to sell, buy and trade the figurines in a large online community across the country, housing over 12,000 members. <br><br>
                Pop! Vinyls can cost anywhere from between $20 to well over $1,000. With Seth&#39;s addiction continuing to grow, the space available in his home is beginning to lessen. <br><br>
                The couple have been forced to move the valuable figures into a private room, which is quickly becoming overcrowded. <br><br>
                His encouraging partner commented on her boyfriend&#39;s hobby: 	&#34;I&#39;m okay with Seth&#39;s collection. It makes him happy. He knows how to handle his money and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t mind his dedication to the Vinyls.	&#34; <br><br>
                &#34;I&#39;ll probably end up selling or trading them until they&#39;re gone,&#34; says Mr Kiely. 	&#34;That won&#39;t be for quite some time; they&#39;ll most likely rise in price again in the near future.	&#34; <br><br>
                Seth says that the best way to start collecting the figures is to enter raffles and competitions as they are usually some of the cheapest ways to win big. <br><br>
                &#34;I think they&#39;re important. Most of the figures are modelled after icons and celebrities â€“ most of whom have passed away or are no longer working. It&#39;s almost like honouring their work. To me, it&#39;s no different to a memorial or a statue. It&#39;s a way of remembering someone and what they did for a specific community.	&#34; <br><br>
                Kiely is certain he has found his own community through his passion. As a dedicated collector, some have found his hobby mildly bizarre, but he insists he won&#39;t be slowing down for anyone any time soon. <br><br>
