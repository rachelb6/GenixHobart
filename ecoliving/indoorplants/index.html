                <p>We are now in a time when we find ourselves spending a lot of time in our homes, staring at the same blank wall day after day. You might have considered doing some home decorating,done some research, and then realised that perhaps redecorating your whole house might cost a bit more than you budgeted for. Well luckily there are some easy and cost effective ways to instantly spruce up your home decor and make your home a clean and healthy place to live! 

                    Plants! Now before I lose all those self proclaimed black thumbs out there, I have news for you, there are so many indoor plants out there that don't require much care and are in fact quite hard to kill.
                    
                    If you scroll down I have given you a list of plants that are great to grow in our Tasmanian weather, including their botanical names and the difficulty in growing them. You&apos;ll find some picture of my own house plants and a little bit about how I find growing them. Enjoy lovelies, and if you have any plant related questions don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.
