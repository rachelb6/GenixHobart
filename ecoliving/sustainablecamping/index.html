                <p>Tasmanians may just be the luckiest people alive, where in this day and age not everyone gets the chance to explore the untouched wilderness that this state has to offer. Every year we see more and more tourists flock to explore the natural beauty of our state, building a strong economy around the tourism industry. One downfall of this every increasing interest is the impact that the increased footfall is having on our environment. The key to exploring Tasmania must be that you are sustainable and responsible. Speaking with sustainable camper Laura Spandler, I had the opportunity to learn some of the key factors to what it is like to be a sustainable camper.

                Laura’s passion for the wilderness has led her to be quite environmentally conscious. When it comes to gear Laura borrowed a majority of it from her parents, until she was able to save up for high quality products that would last a lifetime. Not only will saving up and spending that little bit more on a high quality product save you money in the long run, but it will also save the environment by reducing the amount of poor quality products, that are often single use, end up in landfill.
                
                When it comes to cooking and waste, the food that Laura brings with her is; low waste in terms of plastics, healthy, and only brings as much as she might need to reduce the amount of food wasted. All rubbish is collected in a designated bag and carried along for the entirety of the trip, along with any rubbish that might be spotted along the way. 
                
                “I was taught the seven principles; plan and prepare, camp on durable surfaces, take your waste with you, leave what you find, minimise campfire impact, respect wildlife and be considerate of others. But I also think it’s just about using common sense.”
                
                All these principles can be applied in any scenario, whether you are camping in alpine terrain, dense bushland or tropical forestry. If you are to take anything away from this, I think it should be to use your brain when camping, think sustainable, think green.
