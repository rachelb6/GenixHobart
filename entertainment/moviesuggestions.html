                Filmmaker, George A. Romero said, “Movies are about escape.” So, it is the perfect time to indulge in a movie in your own home and escape the coronavirus world for an hour or two. The films I have picked range from a different emotions and genres. Some are related to staying inside and some are the opposite of what is going on right now. Here is a list of films you should stream on Netflix, Stan and other outlets while you’re self-isolating. 
            </div>
            <div id="centre">
                <h5>
                    Rear Window (1954)
                    Mood: Spying your neighbours 
                    Watch on: Can be rented on YouTube
                </h5>

                <p>Rear Window directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly is the ultimate self-isolation movie. The movie is about photographer who is stuck in his apartment recovering from a broken leg. He sits in front of his apartment everyday and he spies on his neighbours and becomes convinced that one of them committed a murder. The photographer has the same routine, wearing pajamas all day, is visited by a carer and at night his girlfriend visits him as he sits at the same spot every day. I relate to this right now. I am always on my couch whether that be studying, watching tv or anything.  I live right across from a childcare and sometimes I look out and watch them. As I write this, a boy is throwing blocks on the ground as he has a tantrum and the childcare workers run to him. I feel like while we are all inside, we subconsciously glance over at the people around your surroundings. So for that matter, Rear Window is definitely a must watch. </p>

                <h5>Into the Wild (2007)
                    Mood: Longing to go outside and explore.
                    Watch on: Netflix
                </h5>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7ArZ7VD-QQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>
                    Directed by Sean Penn, Into the Wild is about biography about Christopher McCandless who hitchhikes to Alaska to live his life in the wilderness without material possessions. I have seen mixed reviews of the story of McCandless that it is not accurate. However, I feel like the film is a spiritual outer body journey into McCandless’ life. Emilie Hirsh does a fantastic job in portraying him as well. I have seen this film twice, once at school and a month ago with a few friends on Netflix Party. However, I would recommend you watch this film alone like McCandless’ self-discovery journey and let it affect you in whatever way it does.

                <h5>Synecdoche, New York (2008)
                    Mood: Having an existential crisis
                    Watch on: Stan 
                </h5>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvr2wDrLRfs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Synecdoche, New York is a postmodern drama film written and directed by Charlie Kaufman. The story follows a theater director (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is struggling with his work and the women in his life as he creates a life-size replica of New York for his new play. That description is just a very minor part of the film. I do not want to give too much a way because I feel like it is best to watch with fresh eyes. I would also recommend not watching the trailer. When I first watched this film, I was confused yet I felt like I understood it in a sense. Since we are all inside with nothing to do, I think it is worth a few rewatches to grasp the concept. I guarantee this film will linger with you for weeks. I do not understand how I have lived before watching this. I feel like I keep relating my life back to this film.</p>

            <div id="centre">
                <h5>Before Sunrise (1995)
                    Mood: Wanting to fall in love and walk around Vienna with Ethan Hawke
                    Watch on: Foxtel and can be rented on YouTube
                </h5>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25v7N34d5HE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Richard Linklater film Before Sunrise is about an American (Ethan Hawke) and a French student (Julie Delphy) meet on a train from Budapest to Vienna. They end up spending one-night walking around together in Vienna, knowing that it will probably be their only night together. What I love about Before Sunrise is the dialogue. The dialogue in this film does not even feel scripted. It feels so natural like a documentary. Even when the characters do not talk to each other, like the scene in the listening booth where each one looks at the other then looks away not wanting to be caught. It makes me want to scream at the TV “please just kiss already!” This film will make you want to buy a ticket to Vienna and fall in love with a stranger once travel restrictions are lifted. You will also have the urge to binge Before Sunset and Before Midnight.</p>

            <div id="centre">
                <h5>Interstellar (2014)
                    Mood: Have an “out of this world” experience
                    Watch on: Netflix
                </h5>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zSWdZVtXT7E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Interstellar which is directed by the wonderful Christopher Nolan, is set on Earth that has been riddled with disasters, famine and drought. The only way to save mankind is, interstellar travel. A group of astronauts travel through a newly discovered wormhole in space to find a planet that has the right environment to sustain human life. I would not say this is even a film, I would say Interstellar is an experience. This will transport you out of your self-isolation world and into a different dimension. The CGI is so good that it does not even feel like it is computer generated. The star of the film Matthew McConaughey is the anchor of this film and you can feel the raw and emotional connection that he has with his daughter. If you’re missing family right now and you have two hours and forty-seven minutes spare, this space experience will hit close to home.</p>

                <h5>Blast from the Past (1999)
                    Mood: Feeling like you have been in quarantine for 35 years 
                    Watch on: Can be rented on YouTube
                </h5>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_mi3qoA_QY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Blast from the Past is about Adam Weber (Brendan Fraser) who was brought up in a nuclear fallout shelter after following a bomb scare in the 1960s. After 35 years, he comes out into the world to get more food and supplies for his parents. Adam has not seen the world before and has only imagined it from what his parents tell him. When Adam first leaves the shelter, he looks up at the sky. People around him are confused at why he is looking up at the sky, “what are you looking at?” a man says in confusion. Adam exclaims, “The sky!” I have found myself missing the little things in life and somewhat relate to Adam’s character as he sees Los Angeles for the first time. I miss catching the bus. I miss the beach. I miss meeting new people. I miss loud music in nightclubs. Things like that which I have never really thought about or things I used to loathe. I feel like this movie will relate to everyone self-isolating right now.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="centre">
                <h5>Lars and the Real Girl (2007)
                    Mood: Feeling so lonely you order a sex doll
                    Watch on: Stan
                </h5>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNcs9DrKYRU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Lars and the Real Girl stars Ryan Gosling who plays Lars, a delusional young man who orders a sex doll who he names Bianca and begins to have a deep and meaningful relationship with her. This film is not an erotic story. Lars does not do anything sexual with the doll. They actually sleep in separate beds. I feel like this quirky film touches on loneliness and social anxiety in an unusual yet delicate and pure way. All I can say about Lars and the Real Girl is how simple it is, it feels like a tight hug and a warm glass of milk. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="centre">
                <h5>Love (2015)
                    Mood: Doing exactly the opposite of social distancing
                    Watch on: Rent on YouTube
                </h5>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h6dbr_E-Yl8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Directed by Gaspar Noe, Love is a gritty and smutty film about a young American called Murphy who is living in Paris who enters a highly sexual and emotionally charged relationship with Electra. They decide to invite their neighbor Omi into their bed unaware of the effect on Murphy and Electra’s relationship. This is definitely not something to watch for a family movie night. With that being said, should not be labeled as porn. The sex scenes are not a flaw in this film, it is important to the film. I recommend this movie to someone who wants to watch a movie on what you should not be doing while social distancing.</p>

            <div id="centre">
                <h5>Dope (2015)
                    Mood: Missing your friends 
                    Watch on: Rent on YouTube
                </h5>

                <p>Dope is a present day coming of age story about a hip-hop geek called Malcolm who dreams of going to Harvard. He lives in a tough neighbourhood and is invited to an underground party which leads him and his friends to go on a wild adventure around Los Angeles. I feel like this film is great to watch with friends. It would be great if it was on Netflix or Stan. However, there are many platforms where you can share your screen and watch with friends. Dope is so enjoyable to watch and will just make you want to be friends with those characters. This movie is “dope” and also has an amazing soundtrack that will bring back the 90s in your living room.</p>

                <h5>Sommaren med Monika (Summer with Monika) (1953)
                    Mood: Reminisce on your first love
                    Watch On: Kanopy

                <p>Ingmar Bergman’s Summer with Monika is a film about a pair of teens who fall in love with each and decide to leave their hometown and takes a boat somewhere remote to spend an erotic and idyllic summer together. Similar to a few of the films I have mentioned on this list, this film is about escape. I feel like we all want to travel more than ever since we have been staying inside for too long. This film lets you escape your life for a bit but quickly snaps you back to reality. As it is almost the beginning of winter, it feels fitting to put a film which is the complete opposite and let us reminisce on what could be.</p>

                <p>Misery is a film about an author, Paul Sheldon who crashes his car on a snowy Colorado road. He is found by Annie Wilkes who is his “number one fan”. Her obsession turns dark when she realizes that Paul kills off one of her favourite characters in his books. </p>

                    Mood: Coronavirus as a monster

                <p>Bong Joon Ho’s The Host is about a monster that emerges from Seoul’s Han River and attacks the people. Song Kang-ho who plays Gang-du has his daughter snatch. While the rest of his family are in custody by the military in fear a virus has been spread by the creature. While, in detention, Gang-du receives a call from his daughter who says she is trapped in the sewers. With the help of his family, they set off to find her. This film is similar to what is going on right now. There is fear, uncertainty and distance. Some may say it is the worst movie to watch right now. However, I think it is a good one. Also since Bong Joon Ho has became more popular in western media due to winning Best Picture for Parasite this year, you may as well check out some of his other great films.</p>
